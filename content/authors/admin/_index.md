Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at Lehigh University advised by Prof. Cristian-Ioan Vasile. I am highly interested in perception-aware planning and control for autonomous robots with safety and correctness guarantees. 

Before embarking on my journey at Lehigh, I was a visiting research intern at the Intelligent Manipulation Lab, University of Lincoln, UK where I worked on planning and control for human-robot shared manipulation.

My CV is available [here](https://dishakamale.github.io/ddk_hugo/uploads/resume.pdf).
