abstract: This work presents a step towards utilizing incrementally-improving symbolic
  perception knowledge of the robotâ€™s surroundings for provably correct reactive control
  synthesis applied to an autonomous driving problem. Combining abstract models of
  motion control and information gathering, we show that assume-guarantee specifications
  (a subclass of Linear Temporal Logic) can be used to define and resolve traffic
  rules for cautious planning. We propose a novel representation called symbolic refinement
  tree for perception that captures the incremental knowledge about the environment
  and embodies the relationships between various symbolic perception inputs. The incremental
  knowledge is leveraged for synthesizing verified reactive plans for the robot. The
  case studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in synthesizing control
  inputs even in case of partially occluded environments.
