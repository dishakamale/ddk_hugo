abstract: We propose a haptic-guided shared control system that provides an operator
  with force cues during reach-tograsp phase of tele-manipulation. The force cues
  inform the operator of grasping conﬁguration which allows collision-free autonomous
  post-grasp movements. Previous studies showed haptic guided shared control signiﬁcantly
  reduces the complexities of the teleoperation. We propose two architectures of shared
  control in which the operator is informed about (1) the local gradient of the collision
  cost, and (2) the grasping conﬁguration suitable for collision-free movements of
  an aimed pick-andplace task. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed shared
  control systems by a series of experiments with Franka Emika robot. Our experimental
  results illustrate our shared control systems successfully inform the operator of
  predicted collisions between the robot and an obstacle in the robot’s workspace.
  We learned that informing the operator of the global information about the grasping
  conﬁguration associated with minimum collision cost of post-grasp movements results
  in a reach-to-grasp time much shorter than the case in which the operator is informed
  about the local-gradient information of the collision cost.
