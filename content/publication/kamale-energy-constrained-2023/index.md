abstract: We consider the problem of autonomous exploration in search of targets while
  respecting a fixed energy budget. The robot is equipped with an incremental-resolution
  symbolic perception module wherein the perception of targets in the environment
  improves as the robotâ€™s distance from targets decreases. We assume no prior information
  about the number of targets, their locations, and possible distribution within the
  environment. This work proposes a novel decision-making framework for the resulting
  constrained sequential decisionmaking problem by first converting it into a reward
  maximization problem on a product graph computed offline. It is then solved online
  as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) where the knowledge about the environment
  is updated at each step, combining automata-based and MILP-based techniques. We
  demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with the help of a case study and present
  empirical evaluation. Furthermore, the runtime performance shows that online planning
  can be efficiently performed for moderately-sized grid environments.
