abstract: We develop a novel framework to assess the risk of misperception in a traffic
  sign classification task in the presence of exogenous noise. We consider the problem
  in an autonomous driving setting, where visual input quality gradually improves
  due to improved resolution, and less noise since the distance to traffic signs decreases.
  Using the estimated perception statistics obtained using the standard classification
  algorithms, we aim to quantify the risk of misperception to mitigate the effects
  of imperfect visual observation. By exploring perception outputs, their expected
  high-level actions, and potential costs, we show the closed-form representation
  of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of misperception. Several case studies support
  the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.
