abstract: In this paper, we present a grammar-based natural language framework for
  robot programming, specifically for pick-and-place tasks. Our approach uses a custom
  dictionary of action words, designed to store together words that share meaning,
  allowing for easy expansion of the vocabulary by adding more action words from a
  lexical database. We validate our Natural Language Robot Programming (NLRP) framework
  through simulation and real-world experimentation, using a Franka Panda robotic
  arm equipped with a calibrated camera-in-hand and a microphone. Participants were
  asked to complete a pick-and-place task using verbal commands, which were converted
  into text using Google's Speech-to-Text API and processed through the NLRP framework
  to obtain joint space trajectories for the robot. Our results indicate that our
  approach has a high system usability score. The framework's dictionary can be easily
  extended without relying on transfer learning or large data sets. In the future,
  we plan to compare the presented framework with different approaches of human-assisted
  pick-and-place tasks via a comprehensive user study.
