 abstract = {In this paper, we present a grammar-based natural language framework for robot programming, specifically for pick-and-place tasks. Our approach uses a custom dictionary of action words, designed to store together words that share meaning, allowing for easy expansion of the vocabulary by adding more action words from a lexical database. We validate our Natural Language Robot Programming (NLRP) framework through simulation and real-world experimentation, using a Franka Panda robotic arm equipped with a calibrated camera-in-hand and a microphone. Participants were asked to complete a pick-and-place task using verbal commands, which were converted into text using Google's Speech-to-Text API and processed through the NLRP framework to obtain joint space trajectories for the robot. Our results indicate that our approach has a high system usability score. The framework's dictionary can be easily extended without relying on transfer learning or large data sets. In the future, we plan to compare the presented framework with different approaches of human-assisted pick-and-place tasks via a comprehensive user study.},
