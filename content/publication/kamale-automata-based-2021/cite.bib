 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an automata-based framework for planning with relaxed speciﬁcations. User relaxation preferences are represented as weighted ﬁnite state edit systems that capture permissible operations on the speciﬁcation, substitution and deletion of tasks, with complex constraints on ordering and grouping. We propose a three-way product automaton construction method that allows us to compute minimal relaxation policies for the robots using shortest path algorithms. The three-way product automaton captures the robot’s motion, speciﬁcation satisfaction, and available relaxations at the same time. Additionally, we consider a bi-objective problem that balances temporal relaxation of deadlines within speciﬁcations with changing and deleting tasks. Finally, we present the runtime performance and a case study that highlights different modalities of our framework.},
