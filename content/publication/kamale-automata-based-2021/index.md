abstract: In this paper, we introduce an automata-based framework for planning with
  relaxed speciﬁcations. User relaxation preferences are represented as weighted ﬁnite
  state edit systems that capture permissible operations on the speciﬁcation, substitution
  and deletion of tasks, with complex constraints on ordering and grouping. We propose
  a three-way product automaton construction method that allows us to compute minimal
  relaxation policies for the robots using shortest path algorithms. The three-way
  product automaton captures the robot’s motion, speciﬁcation satisfaction, and available
  relaxations at the same time. Additionally, we consider a bi-objective problem that
  balances temporal relaxation of deadlines within speciﬁcations with changing and
  deleting tasks. Finally, we present the runtime performance and a case study that
  highlights different modalities of our framework.
