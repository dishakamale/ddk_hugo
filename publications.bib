	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an automata-based framework for planning with relaxed speciﬁcations. User relaxation preferences are represented as weighted ﬁnite state edit systems that capture permissible operations on the speciﬁcation, substitution and deletion of tasks, with complex constraints on ordering and grouping. We propose a three-way product automaton construction method that allows us to compute minimal relaxation policies for the robots using shortest path algorithms. The three-way product automaton captures the robot’s motion, speciﬁcation satisfaction, and available relaxations at the same time. Additionally, we consider a bi-objective problem that balances temporal relaxation of deadlines within speciﬁcations with changing and deleting tasks. Finally, we present the runtime performance and a case study that highlights different modalities of our framework.},

	abstract = {We propose a haptic-guided shared control system that provides an operator with force cues during reach-tograsp phase of tele-manipulation. The force cues inform the operator of grasping conﬁguration which allows collision-free autonomous post-grasp movements. Previous studies showed haptic guided shared control signiﬁcantly reduces the complexities of the teleoperation. We propose two architectures of shared control in which the operator is informed about (1) the local gradient of the collision cost, and (2) the grasping conﬁguration suitable for collision-free movements of an aimed pick-andplace task. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed shared control systems by a series of experiments with Franka Emika robot. Our experimental results illustrate our shared control systems successfully inform the operator of predicted collisions between the robot and an obstacle in the robot’s workspace. We learned that informing the operator of the global information about the grasping conﬁguration associated with minimum collision cost of post-grasp movements results in a reach-to-grasp time much shorter than the case in which the operator is informed about the local-gradient information of the collision cost.},

	abstract = {This work presents a step towards utilizing incrementally-improving symbolic perception knowledge of the robot’s surroundings for provably correct reactive control synthesis applied to an autonomous driving problem. Combining abstract models of motion control and information gathering, we show that assume-guarantee specifications (a subclass of Linear Temporal Logic) can be used to define and resolve traffic rules for cautious planning. We propose a novel representation called symbolic refinement tree for perception that captures the incremental knowledge about the environment and embodies the relationships between various symbolic perception inputs. The incremental knowledge is leveraged for synthesizing verified reactive plans for the robot. The case studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in synthesizing control inputs even in case of partially occluded environments.},

	abstract = {We develop a novel framework to assess the risk of misperception in a traffic sign classification task in the presence of exogenous noise. We consider the problem in an autonomous driving setting, where visual input quality gradually improves due to improved resolution, and less noise since the distance to traffic signs decreases. Using the estimated perception statistics obtained using the standard classification algorithms, we aim to quantify the risk of misperception to mitigate the effects of imperfect visual observation. By exploring perception outputs, their expected high-level actions, and potential costs, we show the closed-form representation of the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of misperception. Several case studies support the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of autonomous exploration in search of targets while respecting a fixed energy budget. The robot is equipped with an incremental-resolution symbolic perception module wherein the perception of targets in the environment improves as the robot’s distance from targets decreases. We assume no prior information about the number of targets, their locations, and possible distribution within the environment. This work proposes a novel decision-making framework for the resulting constrained sequential decisionmaking problem by first converting it into a reward maximization problem on a product graph computed offline. It is then solved online as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) where the knowledge about the environment is updated at each step, combining automata-based and MILP-based techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with the help of a case study and present empirical evaluation. Furthermore, the runtime performance shows that online planning can be efficiently performed for moderately-sized grid environments.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a grammar-based natural language framework for robot programming, specifically for pick-and-place tasks. Our approach uses a custom dictionary of action words, designed to store together words that share meaning, allowing for easy expansion of the vocabulary by adding more action words from a lexical database. We validate our Natural Language Robot Programming (NLRP) framework through simulation and real-world experimentation, using a Franka Panda robotic arm equipped with a calibrated camera-in-hand and a microphone. Participants were asked to complete a pick-and-place task using verbal commands, which were converted into text using Google's Speech-to-Text API and processed through the NLRP framework to obtain joint space trajectories for the robot. Our results indicate that our approach has a high system usability score. The framework's dictionary can be easily extended without relying on transfer learning or large data sets. In the future, we plan to compare the presented framework with different approaches of human-assisted pick-and-place tasks via a comprehensive user study.},
